1️⃣ Input: TypeScript (TS) or Flow Code
OptiFlow accepts source code in TypeScript (TS) or Flow, leveraging the static type information provided by these languages for subsequent analysis and optimization.

2️⃣ Static Analysis and Shape Inference
- The compiler analyzes the code to understand its structure, data types, and potential object shapes (i.e., the arrangement of properties within objects).
- Shape inference utilizes this analysis to predict the likely shapes of objects created at runtime, a crucial step for optimizing object property access.

3️⃣ Pre-Generation of Hidden Classes
- Based on the shape inference results, OptiFlow proactively generates hidden classes for the anticipated object shapes.
- This pre-generation eliminates the need for the V8 engine to create hidden classes dynamically at runtime, significantly improving startup and execution performance.

4️⃣ Optimize Bytecode
- OptiFlow translates the source code into optimized bytecode, the intermediate representation that the V8 engine can efficiently execute.
- Common optimizations like constant folding, dead code elimination, and loop unrolling are applied.
- Crucially, OptiFlow embeds references to the pre-generated hidden classes directly into the bytecode, enabling V8 to leverage this information for faster property access.

5️⃣ V8 Engine Modification (Optional)
WASM-Like Integration: OptiFlow could be designed to output bytecode in a format that the V8 engine can directly consume, similar to how it handles WebAssembly (WASM). This would bypass the JavaScript parsing and compilation steps, potentially leading to even faster startup times.

6️⃣ Output
- Shape-to-Hidden Class Mapping: A map associating predicted object shapes with their corresponding pre-generated hidden classes.
- Bytecode Generation: Optimized bytecode with embedded hidden class information and potential hints for inline caches.
- Inline Caches (ICs) Enhancement: While not directly generated, the presence of pre-generated hidden classes and hints in the bytecode allows V8's ICs to start in an optimized state, further accelerating property access.

7️⃣ Machine Learning Optimizer and Cloud Sharing (Optional)
- Runtime Data Collection: OptiFlow applications running in production or development environments collect anonymized data on code execution patterns, object shapes, and performance bottlenecks.
- Cloud-Based Model Training: This data is sent to a centralized cloud infrastructure where machine learning models are trained to identify optimization opportunities based on real-world usage patterns.
- Adaptive Optimization: The trained models generate optimization hints or even modify the bytecode directly, which can be downloaded to the runtime environment to adapt the code's execution dynamically.
- Community-Driven Optimization: By sharing and aggregating anonymized data, the machine learning models can benefit from a broader range of usage scenarios, potentially discovering optimizations that would not be apparent from individual applications.
